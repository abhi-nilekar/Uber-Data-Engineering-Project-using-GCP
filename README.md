1. **Cloud Storage**: This is where our journey begins. As a data engineer, I store all the raw Uber data here. It's like a warehouse that holds all the raw materials for our project.

2. **ETL Process**: This is where the magic happens. I take the raw data from Cloud Storage and transform it into a format that's suitable for analysis. It's like refining the raw materials into something more valuable.

3. **Mage VM Compute Engine**: Once the data is transformed, it's stored and processed here. Think of it as a factory where the refined materials are assembled into a finished product.

4. **Analytics BigQuery**: This is my playground. Here, I can run SQL queries on the processed data to extract meaningful insights. It's like a laboratory where I experiment with different hypotheses.

5. **Looker**: Finally, we have Looker. This is where I visualize the data, creating dashboards and reports to better understand the patterns and trends. It's like an art studio where I paint a picture of the data for everyone to see.

So, that's a brief overview of my data engineering project using Uber data on Google Cloud Platform. Each stage plays a crucial role in turning raw data into valuable insights.
